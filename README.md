## Landscape:

* Historical closing prices of bonds stocks and commodities.

* In the past 5 years Fintech personal loan originations increased more than 940% among the top 100 lenders.

* Credit Karma is also involved in credit card refinance, home improvment & debt consolidation.


## Results

* Constructing a portfolio of bonds, stocks, and commodities with over 5 year success

## Recommendations

* Credit Karma should be the first company to offer positive reinforcement when members credit gets better by offering $25 Amazon gift card.

* I think positive reinforcement will make the company grow. Members never expect anything in return. Its a game changer.

* This idea is not much of an investment in technology or service.
