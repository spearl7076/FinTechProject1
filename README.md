* Members looking for a free credit score & financial advice. Members can see free personalized offers and recommendations on their profiles to help them make their next financial move. Credit Karma is a consumer technology company with more than 100 million members in the United States, U.K. and Canada, including almost half of all U.S. millennials.

## Results

* Credit Karma has help members to take control of thier credit score.

* It uses one of the most sophisticated analytics & softwares.

* Credit Karma's competitors include NerdWallet, Credit Sesame, and Mint, which also offer free credit score information and financial tools. Credit Karma amassed annual revenues of over $1 billion for the year 2019. This represents a 100 percent increase from 2017 when the company generated around $500 million in unaudited revenue.

## Recommendations

* Credit Karma should be the first company to offer positive reinforcement when members credit gets better by offering $25 Amazon gift card.

* I think positive reinforcement will make the company grow. Members never expect anything in return. Its a game changer.

* This idea is not much of an investment in technology or service.
